Work In progress

Just playing around with some ideas to generate a good set of unique colors to be used as visual indicators to stencil ID's - i.e used by the StencilViewer class/shader.

Currently looking at creating a scripotableObject asset that holds 256 colors from a swatch texture ( windows palette image ) and for sorting the colors.
